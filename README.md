# Personal Library

In this project I want to create a database of my personal library and keep track of books and other resources I'd like to read in the future.

I want to be able to search through the library by author, title, subject, and date purchased.
I also want the books classified by fiction and non-fiction. And juvenile and adult.
In addition, I want to know where the books are located in my house, or if they are on my Kindle App or iBooks App.
I also want to know the cost of the books for the ones I know. A neat feature would be to be able to see how much I've spent on books and how many books have been purchased in a certain time frame.

I also want to keep track of books loaned out. I want to know who borrowed the book and when they borrowed it.
